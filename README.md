This project aims to develop an evolutionary algorithm system to maximize the amount of money that can be packed into a security van, given a set of 100 bags of money with different denominations, weight, and value. The system reads the information from a file and decides which bags to include in the van based on their weight and value. The fitness function and representation of the problem are left to the developer's discretion. The evolutionary algorithm follows a specific procedure that involves generating an initial population, selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement. The experiment aims to explore the effects of tournament size, population size, and mutation rate on the system's performance. The performance evaluation will be based on a number of randomly seeded trials for each setting of t, p, m, to provide robust results. The termination criterion for the algorithm is set to a maximum of 10,000 fitness evaluations.
